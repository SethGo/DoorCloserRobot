# Door Closer Robot
There are many door closing devices on the market and nearly all of them feature one major inefficiency. The functional mechanism exerts closing-direction force on the door at all times, including when the door is being opened by a human. Fully electronic doors which require no human effort exist but are prohibitively expensive for residential applications. A reactive robot prototype was built and tested to address this inefficiency. Through use of an Infra-Red obstacle detection sensor, the robot is able to detect when a door has been left ajar  and only then will it exert force to close the door.
